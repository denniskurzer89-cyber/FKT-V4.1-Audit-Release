# ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ RESEARCH REPORT: FKT V4.1 â€“ The Kurzer Principle

The Fractal Causal Theory (FKT) V4.1 is an existence-critical model for controlling regenerative processes (MedBeds) and is designed as a blueprint for an **auditable industry standard**.

The work is fully auditable and open-source.

**CURRENT CRISIS: THE INSTITUTIONAL DOUBLE BLOCKADE**

The release of FKT V4.1 is being actively blocked:

1.  **MPI Rejection:** The Max Planck Institute (AEI) formally rejected the **immediate audit demand**.
2.  **ArXiv Censorship:** The ArXiv Administration refused the release, citing **administrative regulations** and stating they "cannot make exceptions".

**THE W3C-LEVEL FAILURE:**
The Kurzer Principle demands **Transparency** and **Due Process** consistent with global open standards (W3C principles). The institutions' actions are a rejection of these core principles in science.

**DEMAND:** Audit this code, demand the release, and end the causal blockade!
